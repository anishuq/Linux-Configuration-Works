			Notice:

only 3.3 is edited and re-written.


===============================================================================

In this exercise you will setup various network filesystems. You have
to compare network filesystems shortly using internet (or book)
sources and your own experiments.

Material

    * Samba
    * NFS: f.e. sourceforge or wikipedia
    * sshfs (and FUSE)


You are required to include the typed commands and their outputs as
usual. See lab instructions.


1.  Preparation
===============================================================================

Log on to two virtual computers (Machine 1 and Machine 2). Add IPv4
aliases (lab1 and lab2) on both the computers to /etc/hosts (see "man
hosts").

Add static addresses to both Lab 1's and Lab 2's eth1 interfaces.

Create two new users (e.g. "testuser1" and "testuser2") with adduser
to both the computers. Ensure that the users have the same UIDs on
both computers (e.g. testuser1 UID is 1001 on lab1 and lab2, testuser2
UID is 1002). The easiest way to do this is to create both users in
the same order to both the computers.


Answer: 

Added the following lines in the /etc/hosts file in virtual machine 1
and 2 respectively for aliases:

10.0.19.1  localhost  lab1
10.0.19.2  localhost  lab2

Added static IP addresses in both machines by editing (/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1):
IPADDR=192.168.1.3
IPADDR=192.168.1.4

Added users alice in machine1 and machine2 and bob only in machine2:
useradd -c "machine1" alice
useradd -c "machine2" alice
Changed UID by:
usermod -u 2009 alice

useradd -c "machine2" bob
usermod -u 2013 bob 


2.  Installing software
===============================================================================

Using yum (8) install unfs3, samba, portmap, nfs-utils and
samba-client if they are not already installed.

Answer: Samba (including samba-client), NFS (including unfs3 and nfs-utils) and 
portmap were already installed.
  

3.  Configuring and testing nfs
===============================================================================

NFS is an acronym for "network filesystem". NFS is implemented for
nearly all unix variations and even for windows.

Export /home via exports (see "man exports"). Reload nfs daemon. Mount
lab1:/home to lab2:/home. You can change user with su, f.e. "su -
testuser1". Now both computers have same home folders.


              ---------------------------
Before we go into the questions, it should be noted that,
I have created four users to work with

alice (uid = 2009),
bob (uid = 2013),
eve (uid = 2011),
and malory (uid = 2012).


Questions:
==========

3.1 What are the problems with NFSv3 'default' installations and
    firewalls? Use (trusted) internet sources AND tell what sources
    you used.

Answer:

If I give the command: rpcinfo -p
the output looks like:
 
    program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100024    1   udp    847  status
    100024    1   tcp    850  status
    100011    1   udp    727  rquotad
    100011    2   udp    727  rquotad
    100011    1   tcp    730  rquotad
    100011    2   tcp    730  rquotad
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   udp   2049  nfs
    100021    1   udp  60073  nlockmgr
    100021    3   udp  60073  nlockmgr
    100021    4   udp  60073  nlockmgr
    100003    2   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   tcp   2049  nfs
    100021    1   tcp  40292  nlockmgr
    100021    3   tcp  40292  nlockmgr
    100021    4   tcp  40292  nlockmgr
    100005    1   udp    741  mountd
    100005    1   tcp    744  mountd
    100005    2   udp    741  mountd
    100005    2   tcp    744  mountd
    100005    3   udp    741  mountd
    100005    3   tcp    744  mountd
 
This table shows the problem. Though nfs and portmap have statically assigned well-known ports namely 2049 and 111
respectively. But the others like mountd, rquotad and status are allocated ports dynamically aasigned by portmapper. 
This causes problem for the firewall setup.  

One way to get around this problem is to give ports used by these services fixed values. This can be achieved by 
editing files associated with specific daemons (e.g. /etc/init.d/nfslock is for nfslock).

3.2 What are the security problems with NFSv3 so-called
    authentication? Are there any alternatives for securing NFSv3?
    (hint: kerberos and NFS)

Answer:

logged in as user alice in virtual machine 2 by: 
ssh alice@farm1.niksula.hut.fi -p 10192

cd /home/bob
-bash: cd: /home/bob: Permission denied
ls -ld /home/bob
drwx------ 2 bob 2010 4096 Oct 19 12:55 /home/bob
[alice@localhost ~]$ su
Password: 
[root@localhost alice]# su bob
[bob@localhost alice]$ cd /home/bob/
[bob@localhost ~]$ 

Here alice and bob are users in nfs client. User bob should be the only one to have access to his data. But Alice has 
knowledge of the super user password. Hence at first she becomes super user and then becomes bob. This enables
her to access bob's data. It is a problem scenario. This happens because the NFS server is accepting user id and group id
as credentials. So when alice gives the command "su bob" (after becoming "su") she 
gets access to bob's user and group id from NFS client's kernel.

Hiding super-user password can help in such situation. A much better approach is using Kerberos V5 
authentication within the NFS traffic. Now, even if alice does "su bob", unless she knows 
bob's Kerberos password, she can never become user bob over the NFS connection.

3.3 Explain shortly booting a diskless linux from network (via tftp
    and nfs) [Edited]

    [Comment: Comepletely re-written.]	

Answer:

Diskless booting is a way to boot a computer entirely from the network without having any storage on the client computer. 
For this the client computer must have a network adapter that is PXE capable. The softwares required for this are: DHCP server, 
TFTP server and NFS. DHCP is used to pass initial configuration information to the client. TFTP on the other hand, allows the 
client to request a file one block at a time.

In this booting process, at first the PXE client boots up and starts up PXE boot ROM. This PXE boot ROM then sends a DHCP/bootp 
query to obtain some PXE-specific information such as the PXE version in use. Having obtained these information it initializes the 
network card, and then uses TFTP to download the boot file in a block by block manner.

The first file retrieved over the network is generally a boot loader. This boot loader will in turn load a configuration file over the network. 
Typically after that, the boot loader will use TFTP to download a kernel image. Once the kernel has been retrieved and uncompressed; 
control will be transferred to it and the booting process will continue.

When the kernel gets control it mounts the root file system over the network using NFS. The kernel performs a DHCP/bootp request 
to get its IP address and the location to mount. It then performs a NFS mount of the root file system from that location. Once mounted 
it transfers control to the init process on the NFS-mounted root file system to continue booting. From here the boot process is basically 
the same as that of a machine booting from a hard drive.

3.4 Is it possible to encrypt all NFS traffic? How? Without (quite
    heavy) full VPN? How about SSH (without TUN VPN)?

Answer:

Yes, it is possible to perform encryption over NFS traffic using SSH (on client & server). We use
SSH tunneling between NFS client and server and hence traffic becomes encrypted. The idea is to mount 
NFS directories in client machines through SSH. 

Assuming both server and client systems have installed and running NFS, SSH services; we first go to
the NFS server to export a NFS directory to itself. Now my server's IP address is 10.0.19.1 and we want
to export /home; so we add the following line to /etc/exports:

		/home 10.0.19.1(rw,root_squash) 

The reason behind this is that, we want the NFS data to go through SSHD which is running in 10.0.19.1. Now the
NFS data will forwarded to client through this SSH tunnel. I am giving read and write permission (it can
also be made read only [ro] if required) and turning on root_squashing ensures that requests from the root user
on a client machine are denied root access to root-owned files on the server machine.  
  
All done ( :D ). Just restart NFS and SSH daemons.

Now we start configuring the client machine.

First I found out the different ports and respective daemons running in the NFS server from client machine by:
rpcinfo -p 10.0.19.1
Output---->

   program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100024    1   udp    847  status
    100024    1   tcp    850  status
    100011    1   udp    601  rquotad
    100011    2   udp    601  rquotad
    100011    1   tcp    604  rquotad
    100011    2   tcp    604  rquotad
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   udp   2049  nfs
    100021    1   udp  54191  nlockmgr
    100021    3   udp  54191  nlockmgr
    100021    4   udp  54191  nlockmgr
    100003    2   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    4   tcp   2049  nfs
    100021    1   tcp  42612  nlockmgr
    100021    3   tcp  42612  nlockmgr
    100021    4   tcp  42612  nlockmgr
    100005    1   udp    615  mountd
    100005    1   tcp    618  mountd
    100005    2   udp    615  mountd
    100005    2   tcp    618  mountd
    100005    3   udp    615  mountd
    100005    3   tcp    618  mountd

Note that, NFS has a port number of 2049 and mountd's is 618 (tcp). I will bind a SSH port 
(16980, this is my birthday.. :D) with the NFS port (2049) with the following command:

ssh -f -c blowfish -L 16980:10.0.19.1:2049 -l alice 10.0.19.1 
     
[Note: in both cases blowfish is the encryption utility. "-L 16980:10.0.19.1:2049" means, binding 
the SSH client at port 16980 with the NFS server @ 10.0.19.1 on port 2049 for communication.]

I then bind another SSH port (14342, this time my father's birthday... :D) with mountd port (618).

ssh -f -c blowfish -L 14342:10.0.19.1:618 -l alice 10.0.19.1 

Now I mount a NFS directory /home through two SSH ports 16980 and 14342 in a local directory 
in the NFS client computer called /mnt/testAnis by:

mount -t nfs -o tcp,port=16980 ,mountport=14342 localhost:/home /mnt/testAnis

Source: http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/117705/49/

3.5 What happens if testuser1 UID is 1001 in lab1, 1002 in lab2 and
    testuser2 is 1002 in lab1, 1001 in lab2? Try or think (and check
    from documentation).

Answer: 
   let testuser1 be eve and testuser2 be malory.
   
   Now eve has uid 1001 in lab1 and 1002 in lab2. Though it is the same user name
   in both machines, they are effectively different users; because of the different
   uid s. 

   Same goes for malory. malory has uid 1002 in lab1 and 1001 in lab2. They are effectively
   different users.

   Now if we want eve (or malory) to be the same user in the whole system (NFS server and client)
   then we must ensure that eve has the same uid in the whole system (one can use usermod -u for this). 
   Also if eve has different uid in lab1 and lab2 then sharing will be denied by nfs. Because 
   it can't figure out if they are the same users or not.	
   


4.  Configuring and testing samba
===============================================================================

Samba is a unix/linux implementation for normal Windows network shares
(netbios and CIFS (common internet filesystem)). You can configure
samba via /etc/samba/smb.conf. You can access samba with command
smbclient or by mounting via mount.

Share /home with read and write permissions (/home shares are already
set in smb.conf but need a little bit of tweaking) and set up and
start samba. Try to mount //lab1/homes to lab2:/mnt/testuser1 with
username testuser1 and testuser1's password. You have to run smbpasswd
with the correct parameters on lab1 first. Check that necessary
services and ports are open.


Questions
=========

4.1 Only root can use mount. What is the problem with home folders? Can this be
    overridden?

Answer:

By default only a root user may mount SMB shares on the command line. Because the 
'mount' programs is setuid (means users with only superuser priviledges can run this).

A good way to get around this problem is by setting the suid sticky bit of 
mount.cifs (umount.cifs for unmounting) (must be done by root) e.g.:
   chmod 4755 /sbin/mount.cifs
   chmod 4755 /sbin/umount.cifs	
   
[Note: Now if you execute the command: ls -l /sbin/ | grep mount*, you will see a 's' 
 added for suid bit for these two files.]

The above works; because lets say, alice (uid = 2009, gid = 2009) logs in and executes the mount.cifs program (or script). 
Now as the suid for this script is set, it will create a child shell process and in turn will execute the process with 
uid and gid of 0 (root). alice cannot excute any script whose suid is not set.    


4.2 When and why may samba be a good choice (hint: interoperability
    with one specific operating system)?

We know that, we can use NFS to share files between Linux machines. But if a network contains both Windows and Linux 
machines, then use Samba. Samba allows files and printers to be shared by all the systems in a network.


5.  Configuring and testing sshfs
===============================================================================

sshfs is Secure Shell Filesystem for FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).

Since the virtual machines have quite little space, we need to make
some room. First umount the samba share on lab2. Then uninstall samba
by "yum remove samba".

Now lets update the kernel and install required files:

input: yum update kernel-xen
input: yum install kernel-xen-devel
input: yum install dkms dkms-fuse

Lets reboot with the new kernel:

input: shutdown -r now (!!!! THIS WILL HANG THINGS !!!!)

You have to wait for a minute or two while the machine boots up
again. Log back in to the machine after a while. (The connection will
refuse until the machine is ready)

Check that that fuse is installed with:

input: modprobe fuse

It should return you straigth to the prompt. Otherwise see
troubleshooting below.

Now mount lab1:/home/testuser1 to lab2:/mnt/testuser1 using sshfs.

Include the commands and outputs in your report that show that the
mount works.
==================================================================
Due to technical difficulties, I could not use lab1 and lab2 
machines for this question (as u might understand from my repeated emails). 
Instead, my remote machine is virtual machine 3, where there is a user 
called alice whose home directory is mounted in the /mnt/testSSH of 
virtual machine 1.


[root@localhost ~]# sshfs alice@10.0.19.3:/home/alice/ /mnt/testSSH
The authenticity of host '10.0.19.3 (10.0.19.3)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 22:f1:7c:f8:c2:4d:4f:01:75:58:76:4f:c3:a9:2d:41.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
alice@10.0.19.3's password: 
[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /mnt/testSSH
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 21 Oct 21 21:02 mySorrow.txt


Then I tested to log into 10.0.19.3 as root and mount the /home into 
/mnt/anotherTest of virtual machine 1.

[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /mnt/anotherTest
[root@localhost ~]# sshfs root@10.0.19.3:/home/ /mnt/anotherTest
root@10.0.19.3's password: 
[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /mnt/anotherTest/
total 4
drwx------ 1 alice alice 4096 Oct 21 21:02 alice


===================================================================
5.1 When is sshfs a good solution?

SSHFS should be used to access files over insecure networks as it
provides sucure mounting of a remote filesystem into a local filesystem 
in the userspace. It provides more security than NFS and Samba, 
by being more restrictive in scope; i.e. in order to get access 
a user needs to have an account and a password on the server. 

5.2 What are the advantages of FUSE?

The biggest benefit is that, FUSE enables normal users to build their own file
systems in userspace without having special privileges or without having to modify 
OS’s kernel source code.


5.3 Why doesn't everyone use encrypted channels for all network filesystems?

Not all communication needs to be encrypetd. Information may also be made
public (might have digital signature with it to ensure integrity and authenticity).
Also a bad side of using encrypted channel (e.g. sshfs tunneling) is that,
things might become heavy weight and hence slow down. 

Thats why if it is not required to hide data, then encrypted channels should
not be used. 

=================================================================================
Troubleshooting:

If you get "FATAL: Module fuse not found." when trying "modprobe
fuse", check that you have the same version of kernel-xen and
kernel-xen-devel (yum list kernel*) and follow the instructions from
the beginning.

You can make more room by removing other kernel versions than the one
in use (uname(1)).

e.g. input: yum remove kernel-xen-2.6.18-128.7.1.el5




6.  Final questions and reporting
===============================================================================

You are required to include the typed commands and their outputs. See
general instructions.

6.1 Describe briefly a few use cases for samba, nfs and sshfs. Where,
    why, weaknesses?

Answer:

Samba:
Apart from the obvious file (one can even mount Linux file system in windows machine!) 
and printer sharing between Windows and Linux systems; Samba is useful when updating web site 
content remotely. If the webserver is running Apache and Linux, then a good idea would be 
to use Samba for updating instead of ftp.    

Weaknesses:
A potential security risk is that, if the mount.cifs program is run with -v (or verbose) option, 
then the value of the password may get printed. 

Secunia Research has also found a security problem in Samba caused by a boundary error within the 
'receive_smb_raw()' function. Using this flaw, an attacker can trick a user into connecting to a 
malicious server.

NFS:

Using NFS, commonly used data can be stored in a single machine and still remain
available for the whole network. Also the need to have separate home directories
for users is eliminated. Storage devices like DVD drives can be shared and hence
reducing hardware costs.

Weaknesses:

When a NFS client sends a request to a NFS server, it specifies file identifier, type 
of operation (read/write/edit etc.) and the user's identity by uid and gid. Now as 
the NFS server authenticates a user based on this, anyone can use a program (e.g. 
nfsshell) to generate a random NFS request and may be able to mount a file system. 
 
SSHFS:

sshfs is used to mount a directory from a remote SSH server and use it as a normal 
directory. sshfs provides an encrypted tunnel between the local and remote computers, 
hence giving increased security.

Weaknesses:

There is considerable latency in executing commands due to the heavy weight of encryption.
If a user is in a terminal whose p.w.d is within the remotely mounted 
directory then all the command execution will slowdown.


6.2 There are many other alternatives. Choose a couple of them and
compare them with the previous.

AFS:
The Andrew File System (AFS) is a distributed networked file system which uses a set of 
trusted servers to present a location-transparent file space for all clients. AFS has 
security advantages over traditional networked file systems; because it uses Kerberos for 
authentication and implements ACLs on directories for users and groups. 

A downside is that,it uses file locking and for this AFS cannot support large shared databases 
or record updates within files that are shared between client systems.

Coda:
Coda is a network file system developed as a research project at Carnegie Mellon University. It
was originally developed in Linux.

Coda was developed at a time when network connections were sometimes unstable,.Thats why
it uses a local cache to provide access to server data in cse of lost network connection. 
During normal operation, if a client marks a data to be important and after a while the 
client is disconnected from the network; then client's local cache serves the data from its 
cache and logs all updates. 

GlusterFS:
GlusterFS is a distributed file system designed for large storage. It has a 
client and server component that are loosely coupled. Server side is kept simple; it exports an 
existing file system as it is and depends on the client-side to structure the stored data. 
The client systems are stateless and do not coomunicate with each other. This lack of communication 
can cause consistancy problems.

Upside to this file system is that, due to the loose coupling, GlusterFS can handle petabytes of data.


7.  Finishing your work
===============================================================================

When finishing your work copy your related files from the lab
computers to a safe place (e.g. your home directory in Niksula or the
Computer Center). Copy your report to /home/answers on Lab machine 1
and make sure it is accessible there at assignment deadline.
